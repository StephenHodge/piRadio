# piRadio
home radio project

RadioPi.py is run at start of raspberry pi,

Aim is to:

+ control volume potentiometer to set the master volume of the Pi
+ tuning potentiometer control which radio stream to play at the twist of the dial
+ control which radio stream band to choose from thanks to which button is pressed
+ have the LED be lit up when tuned in/loaded correctly
+ have led blink when loading
+ drag and update of this file and the streams down from github when both potentiometers are zero and two tune buttons are pressed, this causes it to restart prior to a LED pattern being displayed.
